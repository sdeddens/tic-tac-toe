Tic Tac Toe Pseudo Code

Create tracking variables
  whosTurn boolean;
  totalPlaysCounter;
  trackingObject to track the board's state;

Create Reset Function
  reset whosTurn and totalPlaysCounter
  reset the trackingObject:
    for in loop... set the id's to null strings
    and while in the loop reset the on screen HTML to original state.

Use jQuery to manage mouse click events

  Two possible events

    First possible event: Click on the game grid;
      Use jQuery to extract the clicked button's id selector
      Check board's state in tracking object to see if grid square has already been played
        if played..
          return out of the event and wait for new click event
        else
          update tracking object and the HTML with X or O (depending on player state)
          update totalPlaysCounter and whosTurn variables

        scan the tracking object for the 16 possible winning solutions.
        if winner... announce it and call the reset function.
        check for full board... ie 9 plays and not a winner
        if full... announce "cats game" and call the reset function.

    Second possible event: Click on a "reset" button;
      call the reset function.
